/**
 FlowRepresentable: A typed version of 'AnyFlowRepresentable'. Use this on views that you want to add to a workflow.
 
 Examples:
 ```swift
 class SomeViewController: UIViewController, FlowRepresentable {
     typealias IntakeType = String
 
     var preferredLaunchStyle: PresentationType = .default
 
     weak var workflow: Workflow?
 
     var callback: ((Any?) -> Void)?
 
     static func instance() -> AnyFlowRepresentable {
         return UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: Bundle.main).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "SomeViewController") as! SomeViewController
     }
 
     func shouldLoad(with args: String) -> Bool {
         return true
     }
 }
 ```
 
 ### Discussion:
 It's important to make sure your FlowRepresentable is not dependent on other views. It's okay to specify that a certain kind of data needs to be passed in, but keep your views from knowing what came before or what's likely to come after. In that way you'll end up with pieces of a workflow that can be moved, or put into multiple places with ease. Notice the 'Instance' method. This is needed for Workflow to create a new instance of your view. Make sure that this function always returns a new, unique instance of your class. Note that this is still accomplishable whether the view is created programmatically or in a storyboard.
