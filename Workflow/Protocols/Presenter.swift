 Presenter: Used in the event you want to create your own kind of presenter.
 
 ### Discussion:
 Hopefully the framework takes care of this for you, however there may be situations where you need to create your own presenter. A presenter fundamentally is just an object a Workflow reports to. It gets told when to launch a view, and where to launch it from. It also gets told when to abandon a particular workflow back to the beginning.
